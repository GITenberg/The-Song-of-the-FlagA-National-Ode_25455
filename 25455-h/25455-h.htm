<span class="i0">Up with the country's flag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the winds caress it, fold on fold,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stainless flag, and glorious to behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is our honour's pledge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the token of a truth sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thing to die for, and to wonder at,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, on the shuddering edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some great storm, it waves its woven joy,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which no man shall destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shine or shower, in peace or battle-time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up with the flag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds are wild to toss it, and to brag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of England's high renown,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the throne where Chivalry has sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acclaimed in bower and town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For England's high renown!&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And of these happy isles where men are free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And masters of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The million-mouth&euml;d sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That calls to us from shore to furthest shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fought for us of yore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder-throated, foam-frequented sea<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those wondrous wings of his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which never yet were symbols of despair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the feathery foeman of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shakes adown the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song-scented trills and sunlit ecstasies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye! 'tis the lark, the chorister in gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sings hosannas to the lord of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will not stint the measure of his lay<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As hour to hour, and joy to joy, succeeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he's the morning-mirth of English meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we who mark the moving of his wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know how sweet the soil whereof he sings,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How glad the grass, how green the summer's thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How like a gracious garden the dear Land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loves the ocean and the tossed-up sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the wind has made a coronal;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And how, in spring and summer, at sun-rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds fling out their raptures to the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have the grace of God upon them all.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When round about it ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheers of Britons, bounden, heart and soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deeds of duty, dear to Englishmen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who serves it has a name to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Victory's muster-roll;<br /></span>

<p class="hd4">LOVE LETTERS</p>
<p class="hd5">OF A VIOLINIST</p>

<p class="hd2"><span class="fxl">By ERIC MACKAY</span></p>

<p class="hd1"><span class="smcap">London: Lamley &amp; Co., Exhibition Road, S.W.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Love Letters of a Violinist.</span>'&mdash;Letters to make the ordinary
writer envious, and to awaken in lovers thanks to the poetical pen
that has given forth utterances so suited to their good health or
malady. Here a verse to cheer the almost hopeless; a stanza to teach
the refraining a lesson in charge and capture; lines to fall in love with
the memory, to charm the darkness, and be another light to rule the
day. London was yawning behind her giant hand. The moment was
propitious, and any strain of beauty was sure of an audience. At this
felicitous moment a pipe of splendour sounded. London ceased to
yawn. A violinist was communicating the passions of his heart to
those who would listen, and amid great interest he went from house
to house a-singing.... Eric Mackay is one of those wise men
who have no immature volumes to haunt them. He first asked right
of way on the road to Parnassus with a bundle of melodies which have
never lost their appeal. While youth seeks the pink cheek, these
Love Letters will command the homage of lovers. Your Petrarchs
are not as common as sparrows.... These outpourings from a
burning heart will always compel the student of our literature to weigh
them, sift them, and establish them in some very honourable position.
The charm of this early book is its freedom from drag. It moves
on always. The reader is hastened along; he has wonderful and
unexpected views, which ravish him as the abrupt magnificences of
the Pyrenees ravished Gautier. Perhaps you expect a tree, but you
see a stream. Now, at last, it must be a great green hill, and behold!
you peep down into an echoless mossy depth of glen. At the next
break in the quick, up towers a height of fancy and simile! Thus the
everlasting surprise goes on enchanting. From wild to wild, from
passion to passion, from cavern to star, are we borne, and as we travel
there is music about us&mdash;music of the true tone, ringing with all the
natural pathos of lyrical carelessness. There have been instances in
literature of the music mastering the thought, but in the case under
notice the proportions are justly ministered to. There is thought and
witchery of measure. The ice of craftsmanship is mingled with the
wine of passion."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Norman Gale</span>, in <i>The Literary World</i>, March
10th, 1893.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We are indebted to Eric Mackay for the latest ode to the lark,
one of peculiar gracefulness and impassioned beauty. In my opinion,
this is a better production than either of Wordsworth's, superior to
Hogg's, and, though not so intellectual as Shelley's, rivals it in truth.
Mackay's is the lark itself, Shelley's is himself listening, with unwearied
ears and tightly-stretched imagination, to the lark. Who is surprised
that Eric Mackay's lyric, 'The Waking of the Lark,' sent a thrill
through the heart of America? This poem, which appeared in the
<i>New York Independent</i>, is undoubtedly the lark-poem of the future.
From the opening to the closing stanza there is not an imperfect verse,
not a commonplace. The sentiment is pure, and the fancy glowing.
It is, indeed, an exquisite ode."&mdash;<i>Wintringham's</i> "<i>Birds of Wordsworth.</i>"
Edition, 1892.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"He (the lecturer) ventured to call the author of the 'Love Letters'
a new poet. His published volume is a work of immense promise.
His fancy is splendid.... The 'Love Letters' are twelve poems,
separate, and yet intrinsically one. It is a compound lyric, with an
epic theme and somewhat of an epic cast. The theme is the triumph
of woman's love. It is the story of love's redemption. It has something
of the tone, colour, and luxuriance of Solomon's Song; both,
too, have the same theme, though treated in a different way....
The form is charming&mdash;as if the sonatas of Beethoven had been
translated into poetry! The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is reached when Beethoven
himself&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">'The giant-singer who did storm the gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Heaven and Hell'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">is introduced in a vision. The lecturer gave a number of quotations to
illustrate his points."&mdash;<i>Lecture on</i> <span class="smcap">Eric Mackay</span>, <i>by the Rev. Elvet
Lewis, at the Hull Literary Institute.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The 'Love Letters' of Eric Mackay are the handiwork of a
brilliant metrical artist and poet born.... A beautiful and
passionate work; its beauty that of construction, language, imagery,&mdash;its
passion, characteristic of the artistic nature, and, while intensely
human, free from any taint of vulgar coarseness.... The poem
is quite original, its manner Elizabethan.... Eric Mackay
is a lyrist with a singing faculty and a novel metrical form such as few
lyrists have at command. With the very striking poem of 'Mary
Arden,' we have at last something new said of Shakespeare, and it is
said sweetly and imaginatively."&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. C. Stedman</span>, in "<i>Victorian Poets</i>,"

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
